Logistics Analytics – Data-Driven Supply Chain Optimization
🧭 Introduction
This project was developed as part of an academic data analytics challenge focusing on the logistics and e-commerce sector. Using a real-world transactional dataset, the project aimed to analyze delivery performance, customer behavior, and product trends to uncover operational inefficiencies and provide actionable business insights. The outcome was a series of Power BI dashboards that visualize key logistics metrics and support data-driven decisions.

🎯 Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project were to:

Analyze delivery performance based on region and delivery status

Identify top-selling product categories and their delivery challenges

Evaluate customer job segmentation and their purchasing behaviors

Detect seasonal trends in sales volume and order values

Provide business recommendations to optimize delivery strategies and product inventory

📦 Dataset
Data Sources:
ITBLogisticDataset.csv: Cleaned dataset extracted from a logistics platform for dashboard analysis

Key Attributes:
Order Details: Order ID, Product Category, Delivery Status, Quantity, Price, Order Date

Customer Info: Job title, Location

Shipping Info: Scheduled shipping days, Actual shipping days, Region

🧪 Methods & Analysis
Data cleaning and preprocessing were conducted using Python (Pandas). Data visualization and interactive dashboards were built with Power BI.

Key analytical techniques included:

Descriptive statistics (total orders, revenue, average value per order)

Delivery performance analysis by region and delivery status

Category-level sales concentration and Pareto analysis

Customer segmentation by job type

Time series analysis for monthly sales and late delivery trends

You can open the Power BI dashboard with the LogisticsDashboard.pbix file.

🔍 Key Insights
1. Delivery Performance by Region
Southern Vietnam had the highest proportion of on-time deliveries.

Northern Vietnam faced higher rates of late deliveries.

🧠 Strategy: Investigate logistics partners in the North and improve coordination.

2. Product Category vs. Delivery
Some popular categories (e.g., Household Goods, Beverages) had high late delivery rates.

 Strategy: Optimize inventory and warehousing for high-volume categories.

3. Customer Segmentation by Job
Office Workers and Students were key buyer groups.

 Strategy: Tailor promotions for student-heavy regions and offer flexible delivery slots.

4. Monthly Sales Trends
Peak sales occurred in July and December.

 Strategy: Increase inventory and delivery resources ahead of seasonal peaks.

5. Top Product Categories
Beverages and Beauty Products were top sellers.

 Strategy: Monitor delivery timeliness closely for these high-demand items.
